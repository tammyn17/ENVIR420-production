                                <h3>Producing Hemp</h3>
                                <p>Marijuana and hemp belong to the same plant species (i.e., Cannabis sativa), but hemp is genetically different and also distinguished
                                    by its use and chemical makeup, (0.3% THC or less). Research has found that hemp has been re-discovered as a sustainable, high yielding
                                    industrial fiber crop that can help meet the high global demand for fibers. Additionally, the USDA can actually fund research on hemp, defined as cannabis with no more than 0.3% ∆9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC)
                                    on a dry-weight basis, thanks to legislation that Congress passed in 2018 to legalize hemp in the US. But the USDA still lacks the authority to fund research on cannabis that does not meet the hemp definition.</p>
                                <p>Here are some ways that hemp is sustainable:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Hemp fiber can be used for textiles, clothing, as biocomposites for automobiles, paper, building materials (hempcrete), animal bedding, and has potential as a bio-fuel crop too</li>
                                    <li>Bast fibers can account for 20-30% of the stalks and are used in the automotive and the paper industry. Hurd fibers, on the other hand, make up 70-80% of the stalk and typically
                                        contain 20-30% lignin, which is used for used as a livestock bedding, and other construction applications including fiberboard</li>
                                    <li>Hemp is one of the most efficient plants for converting atmospheric CO2 into biomass. It can absorb more CO2 per hectare than many other crops or even forests, thus playing a significant role in mitigating climate change.</li>
                                    <li>Hemp biomass can be used to produce bioenergy, including biochar, biogas, and ethanol. These renewable energy sources help reduce reliance on fossil fuels, further supporting environmental sustainability.</li>
                                    <li>Hemp generally requires fewer pesticides and herbicides compared to other crops due to its natural resistance to pests and its ability to suppress weeds. This reduces the chemical load on the environment, contributing to more sustainable agricultural practices.</li>
                                    <li>Promotes resource efficiency. The plant's entire biomass can be utilized, minimizing waste.</li>
                                </ul>
                                
                                <h3>Certification Programs</h3>
                                <p>Participating in certification programs can help increase sustainability, here are some of the programs and what participating in them entails:</p>
                                <ul>

                                    </ul>
                                </ul>
